texter (back-end)
</h1>

## ðŸ“ƒ Introduction
This Django project serves as the backend infrastructure for Texter, a web-sockets based chat application. Seamlessly managing backend processes, this project ensures efficient communication and data handling for a robust chat experience.

Following features are leveraged for the application with this project:
- SMS OTP based authentication (token auth.) 
- Web sockets client/server communication
- Managing messages, users, chatrooms and other data.
- Exposing end-points to fetch users' data, messages data, chatrooms data etc.

## APIs
Authentication
- `/auth/user/`
- `/auth/sendotp/`
- `/auth/verifyotp/`
- `/auth/updateprofile/`
- `/auth/activitystatus/`
- `/auth/fetchuser/`
- `/auth/logout/`

Chat
- `/chat/participation/`
- `/chat/chatrooms/`
- `/chat/messages/`
## ðŸ”’ Authentication
Token based authentication flow is implemented with this project where a cookie set on user's browser after succesful verification of users' phone number. Overall flow for the authentication process is as follows:
- User enters their phone number
- A verification code is sent to their number (Twilio)
- User enters the otp
- Back-end verifies the otp, sets a cookie in the response object and sends the response to the client (user's browser)
